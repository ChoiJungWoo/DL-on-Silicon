        It’s likely that, within the next two to three years, the AI industry will converge around one open-source cross-compilation supported by all front-end and back-end environments. Other industry developments in recent weeks call attention to the opening of the AI cross-compilation ecosystem.

        These include:

        - Microsoft’s open-sourcing of a GitHub repo to foster cross-framework benchmarking of GPU-optimized deep learning models.
        - ARM’s partnership with Nvidia to integrate the open-source Nvidia Deep Learning Accelerator architecture into its just-announced Project Trillium platform, designed to enable cross-framework deep learning model compilation for optimized execution in mobile, “internet of things” and other mass-market edge devices.
        - IBM’s launch of the new open-source Fabric for Deep Learning framework, which supports optimized deployment of deep-learning microservices built in TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe2 and other frameworks to diverse compute nodes on heterogeneous clusters of GPUs and CPUs via stateless RESTful interfaces over Kubernetes.
        - Linux Foundation’s launch of the Acumos AI Project, which defines APIs, an open-source framework, and an AI model catalog for framework-agnostic AI app development, chaining and deployment over Kubernetes.
